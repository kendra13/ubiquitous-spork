# I finally have a website?!

It has been 10 years since I want to have my own website! The funny thing is that I made personal & small business websites for a little extra pocket money when I was doing my first undergraduate program. I was too idealistic about what my personal website should look like, I ended up never publish any of my drafts. Alas! It only took 10 years for me to realize it does not matter what the shell look like as long as I get the most happiness out of it. 

I have too many things going on in my head lately I need to write it down. I am currently raising one wonderful boy, doing my second bachelor's program in Mathematics and Actuarial Exams. I enjoy cooking for my family in my leisure time.
